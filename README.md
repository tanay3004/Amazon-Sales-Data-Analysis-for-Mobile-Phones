# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis-for-Mobile-Phones
This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering pipeline designed to process and analyze Amazon's mobile phone sales data. The data encompasses a year's worth of sales from three regions: India, USA, and France. The pipeline employs modern data engineering practices and tools to handle data ingestion, transformation, and visualization effectively.

Project Overview
The Amazon Sales Data Pipeline Project is an integration of various data engineering components that work together to transform raw sales data into insightful analytical reports. The pipeline processes data in multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, and Parquet, using Apache Airflow for orchestration and Snowflake for storage and computation. The final output is a dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends in the data.
